[Grape](http://intridea.github.io/grape/) is [sweet](http://cloud.github.com/downloads/intridea/grape/The%20Grapes%20of%20Rapid.pdf), has a [bunch of stuff](http://intridea.github.io/grape/docs/index.html) that resolves the complaints I had with doing our APIs in sinatra.

 Plus it's sinatra compatible and  generates the most [badass docs]( http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/) I've ever seen.
